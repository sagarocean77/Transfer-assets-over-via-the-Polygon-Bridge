# NFT Collection README

This repository contains scripts and contracts for managing an NFT collection generated using DALLE 2 or Midjourney, stored on IPFS via pinata.cloud, deployed on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet, and mapped to the Polygon network for enhanced functionality. Below are the steps to interact with and deploy the collection.

## Steps to Deploy and Manage the NFT Collection

### 1. Generate Collection Items

Using either DALLE 2 or Midjourney, generate a collection of 5 unique items. Ensure the images are stored on IPFS using pinata.cloud.

### 2. Deploy ERC721 Contract

Deploy an ERC721 contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. This contract will manage ownership and metadata of the NFTs.

### 3. Implement Metadata

Ensure your ERC721 contract includes a `promptDescription` function that returns the prompt used to generate the images. This function aids in providing context to the collection.

### 4. Map NFTs on Polygon

Use the Polygon network token mapper to map your ERC721 collection from Ethereum to Polygon. This step is optional but recommended for scalability and cost efficiency.

### 5. Hardhat Scripts

Write Hardhat scripts for batch minting and transferring NFTs:

- **Batch Minting**: Create a script to batch mint all 5 NFTs. Utilize ERC721A for optimal performance.
  
- **Batch Transfer to Polygon**: Develop a script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge. Ensure NFTs are approved for transfer before initiating the deposit.

### 6. Testing

Test the functionality of the ERC721 contract on Mumbai Polygon:
- Verify balances using the `balanceOf` function on the Mumbai network to ensure NFTs were successfully deposited.

## Repository Structure

- **contracts/**: Contains the ERC721 contract with the `promptDescription` function.
- **scripts/**: Houses the Hardhat scripts for minting and transferring NFTs.
- **tests/**: Includes unit tests for the ERC721 contract.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure your Ethereum and Polygon RPC endpoints in the Hardhat configuration file (`hardhat.config.js`).
4. Deploy the ERC721 contract to the Goerli Testnet using `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli`.
5. Execute the minting and transfer scripts using Hardhat: `npx hardhat run scripts/mint.js --network goerli` and `npx hardhat run scripts/transfer-to-polygon.js --network goerli`.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Additionally, install Hardhat and relevant plugins:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts
```
